## Course aims and structure

### Aims

A gentle hands-on introducton to 
1. Microstructure modelling as a mathematical imaging problem
1. Generative Adversarial Networks - a well-known generative AI framework 

### Structure
- Two ~2-hour lectures: (i) Tuesday 16 July 9:30-11:30 BST, (ii) Friday 19 July 9:30-11:30 BST
- Blend of theory and live coding
- Modest homework in the form of a Jupyter notebook
- Reproducible code to play around with

Lecture 2:
to come

(Note that I am relying on [RISE extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise) to turn the notebooks into slides, which requires some mild adjustments, but they should work as is on your laptops and on Google Colab)
